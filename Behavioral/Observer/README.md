# OBSERVER Design Pattern

## Overview
A behavioral design pattern that establishes a one-to-many dependency between objects. When one object (the subject) changes state, all its dependents (observers) are notified and updated automatically. This pattern is particularly useful for implementing distributed event-handling systems in event-driven software.

## Key Components of the Observer Pattern:
1. **Subject**: Maintains a list of observers and provides methods to register, unregister, and notify observers of changes in its state;
2. **Observer**: Defines an interface with an update method that concrete observers must implement to receive updates from the subject;
3. **Concrete Subject**: A specific implementation of the subject that holds the actual state or data that observers want to track;
4. **Concrete Observer**: Implements the observer interface and reacts when notified of a state change.

## Benefits of the Observer Pattern:
1. One-to-Many Dependence: When there is a one-to-many relationship between objects, and changes in one object should notify multiple dependent objects;
2. Decoupling: You want to promote loose coupling between objects, allowing them to interact without knowing the details of each other's implementations;
3. Change Propagation: When changes in the state of one object should automatically trigger updates in other objects.
4. Dynamic Composition: To support dynamic composition of objects with runtime registration and deregistration of observers;
5. Event Handling: Often used in event handling systems where observers react to events without requiring the source to have explicit knowledge of the observers.

## When not to use:
1. Performance Overhead: Managing and notifying multiple observers can add runtime overhead;
2. Complexity for Simple Scenarios: For simple scenarios, using the Observer pattern might introduce unnecessary complexity;
3. Unintended Broadcasts: There is a risk of unintentionally broadcasting changes to a large number of observers;
4. Overuse in Small Systems: In small applications, the benefits of decoupling and dynamic composition might not be crucial.
