# STRATEGY Design Pattern

## Overview
Allows you to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. This pattern enables the algorithm to vary independently from the clients that use it. It is particularly useful when you need to select an algorithm at runtime based on specific conditions.

## Key Components of the Strategy Pattern:
1. **Context**: This is the class that holds a reference to a strategy object and delegates the task to it. The context provides a unified way to execute the task without knowing the details of how itâ€™s done;
2. **Strategy Interface**: This defines a set of methods that all concrete strategies must implement. It serves as a contract, ensuring that all strategies adhere to the same set of rules and can be used interchangeably by the context;
3. **Concrete Strategies**: These are the various implementations of the strategy interface. Each concrete strategy provides a specific algorithm or behavior for performing the task defined by the strategy interface;
4. **Client**: The client is responsible for selecting and configuring the appropriate strategy and providing it to the context.

## Benefits of the Strategy Pattern:
1. Improved code flexibility and better code reusability;
2. Useful in scenarios where multiple algorithms can be used interchangeably, such as sorting algorithms, validation rules, text formatting, and payment processing;
3. Simplified testing.
