# ABSTRACT FACTORY Design Pattern

## Overview
The Abstract Factory Design Pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

## Benefits:
1. Separates the creation of objects, allowing clients to interact with objects through abstract interfaces without knowing specific classes;
2. Acts as a blueprint for creating different types of objects, ensuring consistency and allowing easy switching between types;
3. Respects the Open-Closed Principle (OCP) and delegates the responsibility for creating objects to specific classes using polymorphism;
4. Isolates concrete classes and promotes consistency among products.
