# FACTORY METHOD Design Pattern

## Overview
Create objects without exposing the creation logic to the client and refer to a newly created object using a **common interface**.

## Benefits of the Factory Method Pattern:
1. Encapsulating object creation and reducing coupling;
2. Central point of control and configuration for object creation;
3. Promoting the open-closed principle (OCP);
4. Testing and mocking of the client code.
