# DESIGN PATTERNS IMPLEMENTATION

## Overview
Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint that you can customize to solve a particular design problem in your code.

## Benefits of the Designs Patterns:
Patterns are a toolkit of solutions to common problems in software design. They define a common language that helps your team communicate more efficiently.

## Classification of the Designs Patterns:
Design patterns differ by their complexity, level of detail and scale of applicability. In addition, they can be categorized by their intent and divided into three groups.

## The Catalog of Design Patterns:
List of 22 classic design patterns, grouped by their intent.

### Creational patterns
These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
 
1. Factory Method;
2. Abstract Factory;
3. Builder;
4. Prototype;
5. Singleton.

### Structural patterns
These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

1. Adapter;
2. Bridge;
3. Composite;
4. Decorator; 
5. Facade;
6. Flyweight;
7. Proxy.

### Behavioral patterns
These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

1. Chain of Responsibility;
2. Command;
3. Iterator;
4. Mediator;
5. Memento;
6. Observer;
7. State;
8. Strategy;
9. Template Method;
10. Visitor.
