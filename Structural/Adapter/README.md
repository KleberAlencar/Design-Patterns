# ADAPTER Design Pattern

## Overview
The Adapter Design Pattern converts the Interface of a Class into another Interface that clients expect. This design pattern lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible Interface.

## Key Components of the Adapter Pattern:
1. **Target Interface**: Defines the interface expected by the client. It represents the set of operations that the client code can use;
2. **Adaptee**: The existing class or system with an incompatible interface that needs to be integrated into the new system;
3. **Adapter**: A class that implements the target interface and internally uses an instance of the adaptee to make it compatible with the target interface;
4. **Client**: The code that uses the target interface to interact with objects. It remains unaware of the specific implementation details of the adaptee and the adapter.

## How It Works:
1. **Client Request**: The client initiates a request by calling a method on the adapter using the target interface;
2. **Adapter Translation**: The adapter translates or maps the client’s request into a form that the adaptee understands, using the adaptee’s interface;
3. **Adaptee Execution**: The adaptee performs the actual work based on the translated request from the adapter;
4. **Result to Client**: The client receives the results of the call, remaining unaware of the adapter’s presence or the specific details of the adaptee.

## Benefits of the Adapter Pattern:
1. **Integration of Existing Code**: When you have existing code or components with interfaces that are incompatible with the interfaces expected by new code or systems;
2. **Reuse of Existing Functionality**: When you want to reuse classes or components that provide valuable functionality but don’t conform to the desired interface;
3. **Interoperability**: When you need to make different systems or components work together, especially when they have different interfaces;
4. **Client-Server Communication**: When building client-server applications, and the client expects a specific interface while the server provides a different one;
5. **Third-Party Library Integration**: When incorporating third-party libraries or APIs into a project, and their interfaces do not match the rest of the system.

## When Not to Use:
1. **Stable Interfaces**: If the interfaces of the existing system and the new system are stable and not expected to change frequently;
2. **Direct Modification Feasible**: If you have control over the source code of the existing system, and it’s feasible to directly modify its interface to match the target interface;
3. **Performance Critical**: In performance-critical applications where the overhead introduced by the Adapter pattern is not acceptable;
4. **Multiple Adapters Required**: If a system requires numerous adapters for various components, and the complexity of managing these adapters becomes overwhelming;
5. **Adapters Introduce Ambiguity**: When introducing adapters leads to ambiguity or confusion in the overall system architecture.
