# COMPOSITE Design Pattern

## Overview
The **Composite** is a structural design pattern used in software engineering to represent part-whole hierarchies. It allows you to compose objects into tree structures, enabling clients to treat both individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

## Key Components:
1. **Component**: An interface that defines the common operations for both leaf (individual objects) and composite (composed objects).
2. **Leaf**: Represents individual items in the hierarchy and implements the component interface.
3. **Composite**: Can contain both leaf nodes and other composites, managing a collection of child components.

## Advantages:
1. **Simplifies Client Code**: Clients can interact with both simple and complex objects uniformly.
2. **Hierarchical Representation**: Ideal for tree-like structures such as file systems, GUIs, and organizational charts.
3. **Flexibility**: Easily add or remove components without affecting the client code.
4. **Scalability**: Supports nesting of composites within composites for complex structures.

## Use Cases:
1. **File Systems**: Representing files and directories in a hierarchical structure.
2. **Graphics Applications**: Managing shapes and groups of shapes in a drawing application.
3. **Organizational Structures**: Modeling departments, teams, and employees in a company.

## When not to use:
1. **Complex Implementation**: Requires creating a common interface for both leaves and composites, which can increase complexity.
2. **Performance Overhead**: Traversing deep hierarchies can be resource-intensive.
3. **Reduced Type Safety**: Uniform interfaces may lead to runtime errors if inappropriate operations are performed.
