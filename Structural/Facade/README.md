# FACADE Design Pattern

## Overview
Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. The Facade Design Pattern defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

## How It Works:
1. **Identify Complex Subsystems**: First, identify the complex parts of your system that need simplification. These could be complex libraries or systems with multiple interacting classes;
2. **Create a Facade Class**: Design a facade class that provides a simple interface to the complex subsystems;
3. **Delegate Calls to Subsystems**: The facade should delegate the client requests to the appropriate objects within the subsystem. The facade should handle all the intricacies and dependencies of the subsystems;
4. **Client Code Interaction**: The client interacts with the system through the facade, simplifying its use of the complex subsystems.

## Benefits of the Facade Pattern:
1. **Simplified Interface**: Provides a clear and concise interface to a complex system, making it easier to understand and use;
2. **Reduced Coupling**: Decouples clients from the underlying system, promoting modularity and reusability;
3. **Encapsulation**: Encapsulates the complex interactions within a subsystem, protecting clients from changes in its implementation.

## When Not to Use:
1. **Increased Complexity**: Introducing a facade layer adds an extra abstraction level, potentially increasing the overall complexity of the system;
2. **Reduced Flexibility**: The facade acts as a single point of access to the underlying system, which can limit flexibility for clients who need to bypass the facade;
3. **Overengineering**: Applying the facade pattern to basic systems can be overkill, adding unnecessary complexity.
